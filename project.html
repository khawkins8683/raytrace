    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <div class="textContainer">
            <p>Typically when dealling designing optical systems, 
                engineers rely on ray tracing to calculate the paths and phases of light inside of a system.
                This method ignores much of the wave nature of the light except for the frequency or wavelength properties.
                Polarization ray tracing aims to extend these methods by also including the effects of the waves geometry (Polarization), by the optical system.

            Since light is a transverse wave it is driven forward by an oscilating electric (and magnetic) field.  This field can move in the vertical direction, horizontal direction, or at any angle in between.  
            The electric field can even oscilate in a circular pattern if the movement in the x and y directions are out of sync.
            The orientation and phase of the electric field oslication is the light's polarization.
            This example will go throught the methodology and importance of Polarization in optical design.

            <p>We think that the concept of polarized light was first observed in 1669 (Erasmus Bartholinus, Dutch) by viewing double refraction through calcite crystal.
                For the next 200 + years much more observations and mathematical descriptions of polarized light were made (Malus Law ~1808, Fresnel Coeffiecients ~1830),
                but it was not until 1941, that a rigorus description of the pheomina was concieved by R.C. Jones.  The American born physicist, methodology (now know as Jones Calculs),describes Polarized light with a complex two dimensional "Jones" vector, and describes the optical interaction of polarized light with optical componets using a complex 2 by 2 Jones Matrix.

            This calculus describes fully polarized coherent light and how its interactions. Jones vectors describe the electric field amplitude and phase.  A little later on (1943), Hans Mueller, developed an overlapping calculus to describe incoherent interactions in terms of intensities.
            Though both methods should be used to get the complete polarization picture, we will focus on extending the Jones Calculus methods, so that they can be used durring ray tracing.

      The amount of light that reflects and refracts off of an optical interface, depends on the incident polarization and can be calculated using the Fresnel Equations (~1830, Augustin-Jean Fresnel, French).  
      The equations divide the incident wave into two componets, call S and P polarizations.  Where the S, polarized direction is perpendicular to the plane of refraction, and the p state is parallel to the plane of refraction.

        Though these Jones matricies will describe the optical polarization effects, they are somewhat limited in their applications to Polarized Ray tracing.  This is because the Jones vector describes the electric field in terms of an x and y component.  This has the implicit assumption that the light is propagating the the z-direction.  
        Since one of the main goals of ray tracing is to calculate the change in propagation direction due to optical interactions, this formalation is clearly inadiquate.  To apply this methodoly to three-D ray tracing, one must extend the Jones matrix into a three-D version.

            This method, takes the the Jones matrix in local s-p space and transforms it into the global coordinate system, such that the resulting PRT matrix describes the polarized effects of the surface as well as the geometrical change in the ray propageiont direction, and s and p polarization directions at the given interface.
            The PRT matrices at each surface can then be multiplied together to represent the total polarization effects along a given ray path.

        Two quantities that are very important for optical designers to understand are diattenuation and retardance.  
        These values will describe the polarization aberrations of the system.  Polarization aberrations are polarization dependent deviations in both amplitude and phase from an ideal wave front.
        The diattenuation will describe the amplitude deviation, and is defined as follows.

            To analyze this system the optical engineer will need to trace a grid of rays through the system.  At each surface a PRT matrix will be used to calculate the surface polarization effects.
            Once the ray reaches the detector, all of the individual surface PRT matrices can be multiplied together to calculate the polarization effects along the entire ray path.
            Then, the eigen values of the $PRT_total$ matrix, can be calculated.  Since it is a 3 by 3 matrix, their will be three eigen values.  By definition of the PRT matrix one of the eigen values will be 1, this corresponds to the propagation direction eigen value, which must be unity.
            The other two eigen values will most likely be complex, and the difference in phase between the eigen values will calculate the retardance.  The maximum and minimum transmission values used to calculate the diattenuation can be acertained by taking the absolute square of the eigen values.
